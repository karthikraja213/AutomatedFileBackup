# AutomatedFileBackup
The Automated File Backup System offers a user-friendly, secure, and cost-effective
solution for reducing the risk of local file loss due to hardware failure, accidental deletion, or
cyberattacks. Using free/trial-tier services from major cloud providers, the project is affordable
while still offering functionality. With a carefully structured DevOps process—including
automated builds, testing, and deployment—the system is robust and scalable, making it
suitable for individuals and small businesses alike.
